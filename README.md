# Crypto

First project in the **Project A Week** (PAW) series where I try to build/learn something in a week.

Starting off with a tiny mobile app that shows the price and change in percentage of some of the
popular cryptocurrencies. Uses the [CoinMarketCap API](https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/)
to get the data.
